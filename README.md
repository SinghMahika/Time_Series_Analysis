# Time_Series_Analysis

- This notebook is my first attempt towards learning Time Series Analysis. 
- It includes data cleaning, data visualization, data stationarity check and finally prediction of values.
- It follows the instructions given by Krish Naik in one of his Time Series Videos.
- It would help people new to Time series analysis in understanding the basic steps involved in the analysis and implementation of ARIMA model.
